## üëÄ About
This project includes a sample implementation of an Adaptive Automated Market Maker (AMM) using GenLayer. The project demonstrates two different approaches to market making:

1. A basic AMM with simulated fixed values
2. An advanced AMM that simulates real market behavior using CCXT (currently in development)

## üì¶ What's included
- Basic requirements to deploy and test your intelligent contracts locally
- Configuration file template
- Test functions to write complete end-to-end tests
- Two implementations of an Adaptive AMM contract
- Example end-to-end tests for the contracts provided
- Vue.js frontend to interact with the contracts

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements
- A running GenLayer simulator (Install from [GenLayer Simulator](https://github.com/yeagerai/genlayer-simulator)). This repository code does not need to be located in the same directory as the Genlayer Simulator.

## üöÄ Steps to run this example

### 1. Configure environment
   Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env`, then fill in the values for your configuration.

### 2. Deploy the contract
   Deploy either the basic AMM contract from `/contracts/amm_adaptative.py` or the simulated version from `/contracts/amm_adaptative_simulated.py` using the Simulator's UI:
   1. Open the GenLayer Simulator interface in your web browser (usually at http://localhost:8080).
   2. Create a new file in the "Contracts" section and paste the content of your chosen contract.
   3. Navigate to the "Run and Debug" section.
   4. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the deployment process.

### 3. Setup the frontend environment
  1. All the content of the dApp is located in the `/app` folder.
  2. Rename the `.env.example` file in the `/app` folder to `.env`.
  3. Add the deployed contract address to the `/app/.env` under the variable `VITE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`

### 4. Run the frontend Vue app
   Ensure your GenLayer Simulator is running, and execute the following commands in your terminal:
   ```shell
   cd app
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
   The terminal should display a link to access your frontend app (usually at http://localhost:5173/).
   For more information on the code see [GenLayerJS](https://github.com/yeagerai/genlayer-js).

## ü§ñ How the Adaptive AMM Contracts Work

The project includes two different implementations of an Adaptive AMM:

### Basic AMM (`amm_adaptative.py`)
This contract provides a basic implementation with fixed simulated values. It's useful for testing and development purposes. Features include:
- Simulated order book data
- Fixed current price and volume
- Predefined open orders and balances
- Basic market making logic using LLM

### Advanced Simulated AMM (`amm_adaptative_simulated.py`)
This contract provides a more realistic market making simulation using CCXT. Features include:
- Real-time market data simulation
- Dynamic order book management
- Realistic price and volume simulation
- Advanced market making strategies
- Balance and order constraints
- Volatility-based adjustments

Note: The advanced simulated version is currently under development due to encoding issues with CCXT integration.

## üß™ Tests

This project includes integration tests that interact with the contracts deployed in the simulator. These tests cover the main functionalities of both AMM implementations:

1. Order book retrieval
2. Price and volume queries
3. Order management
4. Balance checks
5. Market making strategy execution

To run the tests, use:
```shell
pytest test
```
